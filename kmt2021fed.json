the \u201cGive\nBack My Referenda\u201d Operation, KMT Pushes Forward \u201cTie Referenda to General\nElections\u201d Referendum\nToday (August 18th),\nKuomintang (KMT) Chairman Johnny Chiang, along with Culture and Communications\nCommittee Director Alicia Wang (\u738b\u80b2\u654f), Institute of\nRevolutionary Practice Director Lo Chih-chiang\uff08\u7f85\u667a\u5f37\uff09,\nNegative Vote Association Director-General Tien Shang Chang\uff08\u5f35\u5929\u9dde\uff09, and founding member of the Sustainability via\nNuclear Power referendum Huang Shih-Hsiu\uff08\u9ec3\u58eb\u4fee\uff09, jointly\nconvened a press conference, pledging to push forward a \"Tie Referenda to\nGeneral Elections\" referendum with Chairman Chiang in the leading role and\nDirector Lo as Chief Operating Officer.\nChairman Chiang stated\nthat ever since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took power in 2016, the\nvoice of the people has not been heard in the Legislative Yuan due to the DPP's\ntyranny of the majority, exposing the importance of direct democracy even more.\nFurthermore, when the DPP was not in power, it always advocated for and pursued\ndirect democracy. The 2017 referenda law amended the provision, stating that\n\"Referenda should be tied to the general elections.\" At that time,\nPresident Tsai Ying-wen said, \"Break the birdcage, return power to the\npeople. At this juncture of history, the people make the decisions.\" Yet\nin the end, President Tsai allowed the people to be their own masters for merely\na year and a half; afterwards, it became \"the DPP makes the\ndecisions.\" Simply because the 2018 referendum results were not what they\nexpected, the DPP turned the \"birdcage referendum\" into the\n\"iron-cage referendum,\" contradicting the values that they themselves\nfought for for over 30 years and damaging the rights and interests of the\npeople.\nChairman Chiang pointed\nout that raising the issue of referenda today is to confront a crisis of\ndemocracy and to break the iron cage, giving the right to referenda back to the\npeople. The question of the referendum is as follows: \"If there is a\nnational election within one to six months after this referendum case\nannouncement, should a referendum be held on the same day?\u201d\nSince he personally takes the leading role, he is also appealing to the people\nto cosign with him together.\nLo Chih-chiang pointed\nout that Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-Mai said the following sentences: \u201cTying referenda\nto the general election is a disaster\u201d and \u201cMost referenda in the world are\ntied to general elections.\u201d Lo questions how the DPP could go so far as to now\ntrample the dreams of Chai Trong-rong and Lim Gi-hiong, two DPP seniors who upheld\nreferenda as their lifelong pursuit. Lo emphasized that pushing for the tying\nof referenda and general elections is not only the KMT\u2019s matter, but also the\nmatter of all people in Taiwan. Lo will travel all over Taiwan and rouse\nTaiwan\u2019s democracy by means of public speeches, taking part in informal\ndiscussions, and cosigning, all beginning from the streets of Taiwan.\nNegative Vote\nAssociation Director-General Tien Shang Chang then stated that he is very happy\nto see that the KMT is willing to take the lead in pushing for an amendment to the\nreferenda act. He also pointed out that referenda throughout the world are\noverwhelmingly tied to general elections. For example, in an advanced democracy\nlike California, the law stipulates that referenda are tied to general\nelections. In another advanced democracy, Switzerland, although referenda are\nnot tied to general elections, there is no lower threshold for approval votes.\nThese are both examples that Taiwan should learn from.\nHuang Shih-Hsiu then took\nhis own signing of the passed \u201cReferendum on the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant\u201d as\nan example. This referendum became legal precedent last year, but the\nLegislative Yuan immediately amended the law to separate referenda from general\nelections, causing the vote for the referendum to be postponed until 2021. At\npresent, the referenda act stipulates that the minimum threshold for approval votes\nis five million ballots. However, in 2018, there was a \u201cSustainability via\nNuclear Power\u201d referendum that obtained a 60% approval rate, and it obtained\nonly six million approval ballots while being tied to the nine-in-one local elections.\nIf it wasn\u2019t tied to the general elections, would it still have passed? Huang dares\nnot be optimistic about this.\nConfused, Huang\nShih-Hsiu asked, \u201cWhy is the DPP so afraid of the Referendum on the Fourth\nNuclear Power Plant?\u201d He was also happy to see the KMT, for the sake of all\nTaiwanese people, fight for the right to referenda, because this value of \u201cDirect\nDemocracy\u201d was pursued by the DPP for over thirty years, yet after they\nobtained power they threw it away themselves, and it is the KMT who must now\npick it back up. Huang Shih-Hsiu also explained that he will join other civic\norganizations and continue to push for amendments to the referenda act,\nincluding absentee voting, electronic signing, and abolishment of the approval\nvote minimum threshold, etc.\nAlicia Wang stated, President\nTsai Ing-wen once said that the story of absolute power corrupting absolutely\nwould not take place, yet based on what we have seen of the DPP\u2019s absolute\npower in the Legislative Yuan, the results and costs have been repeated\nincidents of corruption and abuse of authority. When did Taiwan turn into a\nsociety that limits and reduces freedom of speech? When did Taiwan\u2019s democracy\nturn into the DPP president\u2019s and premier\u2019s final decision? Wang emphasized\nthat the DPP\u2019s abuse of absolute power has reached a zenith, and now the\nsupervisory power of Taiwan\u2019s checks and balances has been met with a grave\nchallenge. To confront the DPP\u2019s massive dictatorial abuse of authority\nrequires even more strength from Taiwan\u2019s democracy and people. For example, combining\nreferenda and general elections is even more so a practical, direct, and\nimportant method for democratically returning power to the people.\nPremier Su Tseng-chang\nonce said, \u201cTying referenda to general elections can cut down on expenditures\nand can let public opinions be expressed directly.\u201d Holding referenda on their\nown requires about NTD$800 million in expenditures; conversely, tying them to\ngeneral elections can help the people save this sum of money. Alicia Wang\nexclaimed, \u201cWhat Su Tseng-chang said before is correct! Why is what he is doing\nnow wrong?\u201d\nIn order to defend the\npeople\u2019s right to referenda, the KMT will officially launch the \u201cGive Back My\nReferendum\u201d campaign. With Chairman Johnny Chiang in the leading role and Lo\nChih-chiang as Chief Operating Officer, the KMT will start the \u201cReinstate the\nTying of Referenda to General Elections\u201d signature drive. In the future, the\nKMT will also join with every type of people\u2019s livelihood, societal, and\nenvironmental protection topics; join with the Legislative Yuan party caucus; and\njoin with the \u201cYe Tai\u201d live broadcast, etc. In this way, this topic will spill\nonto the streets, and democratic checks and balances will spill onto the\nstreets, building the KMT\u2019s strength from the grassroots.\n\u00a0\n\n"
